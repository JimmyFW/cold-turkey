Next up on what I want
- some way to record when I visit YouTube, how long I spend per session
- some way to hold myself accountable for what I do on YouTube. Writing down my original purpose for visiting the site and the amount of time I expect to spend would be a start
- if I implement the accountability log, I would want some way to visualize and categorize my behavior. One important category is when I visit with the express purpose of surfing around, and I don't budget off time for my session. When the counter for this category gets too high I know I need to recalibrate my behavior.
